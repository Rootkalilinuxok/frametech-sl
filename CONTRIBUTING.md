# Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

- **Branch naming:** Use clear prefixes (feature/, fix/, chore/, codex/auto-fix-)
- **Pull Request:** Make sure all tests, lint, and build pass before requesting review.
- **Commit messages:** Should be descriptive, e.g. `[dashboard] Fix crash on login`
- **No secrets:** Never commit `.env` files or any secrets.
- **Automation:** Codex and other AI automations should respect [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) and not merge if build/tests fail.

Refer to the [README.md](./README.md) and [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for detailed instructions and policies.
