## Project Vision

The goal is to create an open-source admin template that includes multiple example screens, prebuilt sections, and thoughtfully designed UI patterns, all supported by a clean architecture and proper project setup.

It aims to serve as a strong starting point for SaaS platforms, internal dashboards, and admin panels, with built-in support for multi-tenancy, RBAC, and feature-based scaling.

---

## Overview

This project uses `Next.js 15 (App Router)`, `TypeScript`, `Tailwind CSS v4`, and `Shadcn UI` as the main stack.  
It also includes `Zod` for validation, `ESLint` and `Prettier` for linting and formatting, and `Husky` for pre-commit hooks.  

It supports `React Hook Form`, `Zustand`, `TanStack Table`, and other related utilities, and will be added with upcoming screens. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) with config-driven UI and multi-tenant UI support are also planned as part of the feature roadmap.

The current version uses the [Tweakcn Tangerine](https://tweakcn.com/) theme for UI.

> Looking for a **Next 14 + Tailwind CSS v3** version instead?  
> Check out the [`archive/next14-tailwindv3`](https://github.com/arhamkhnz/next-shadcn-admin-dashboard/tree/archive/next14-tailwindv3) branch.  
> This branch uses a different color theme and is not actively maintained, though I'm trying to keep it updated with the latest changes and screens.

## üß† AI-powered Vercel Deploy Debugger

This project includes an **AI watcher script** (`ai-deploy-watcher.js`) that automatically monitors Vercel deploy errors, analyzes build logs, and provides OpenAI-powered suggestions for fixes.

- All AI logs are saved in `ai-deploy-watcher.log`.
  **Check this log before opening a Pull Request** to quickly identify and resolve build errors.

- The watcher runs automatically in cloud workspaces (Codex, CI) or can be launched locally with:
  ```sh
  node ai-deploy-watcher.js
  ```

  Ensure the environment variables `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `PROJECT_ID`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are set before running the script.
